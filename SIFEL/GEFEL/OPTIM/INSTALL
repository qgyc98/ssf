Installation
============

1) Create your own directory, e.g. 'mkdir YOUR_DIRECTORY', for your
problem wherever you want to. Recommended is to use particular EXAM
directory (i.e. MEFEL/EXAM etc.) for this purpose.

2) Copy template file 'SIFEL/PRG/GEFEL/OPTIM/user_obj_funct.cpp' to your
directory from previous step. You can rename this file. Add your
problem/objective function in this file. Comments where to add your
lines are in the file. Also you can look at examples in GEFEL/EXAM.

3)a) If you don't want to type long paths to all scripts, that are
needed hereafter, go to the top SIFEL directory and type 
'. sifel_shell_var.sh' - this will add needed paths into the system
(shell) PATH variable.

b) Run script 'optim_install.sh' from 'SIFEL/PRG/GEFEL/OPTIM/' to
install your problem into particular source directory, e.g. type
'optim_install.sh your_file.cpp ../../SRC/' if you are in the
'SIFEL/PRG/MEFEL/EXAM/YOUR_DIRECTORY/' directory.

4) Check if there is a file "parameters.cfg" in directory from where
you will be running program, i.e MEFEL, GEFEL etc. If not, copy it
from GEFEL/OPTIM.

5) Run appropriate program with your data, e.g. 
   "mefel EXAM/YOUR_DIRECTORY/your_data.in"
