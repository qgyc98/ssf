\chapter{Numerical integration}

The code uses several types of integration. Finite elements require
integration with respect to their dimension, it means one-dimensional
finite elements require one-dimensional integration, etc. Two-dimensional
elements require except of the two-dimensional integration over their
area also integration over their edges. This is the case of various
boundary conditions. Three-dimensional finite elements require
except of the three-dimensional integration over their volume also
integration over their surfaces (two-dimensional integration)
and integration over their edges (one-dimensional integration).

Almost all integration performed in the code have to be computed
numerically because an analytical integration is difficult or
awkward. Therefore, this chapter is devoted to the numerical
integration.
