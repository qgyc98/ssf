\section{General strategy}

Transport processes are based on gradients of suitable variables and on fluxes of mentioned variables.
Connection between gradients and fluxes guarantees constitutive laws. Consider transport of one medium,
e.g. heat. Basic variable is temperature. Gradient of temperature is denoted
\begin{equation}
\mbf{g} = {\rm grad}\ T = \left(\ppd{T}{x},\ \ppd{T}{y},\ \ppd{T}{z}\right)^T\ , \ \ \ \ \
g_i = \ppd{T}{x_i}\ .
\end{equation}
Flux of heat is defined by Fourier's law
\begin{equation}
\mbf{q} = \mbf{D} \mbf{g}\ ,\ \ \ \ \ \
q_i = D_{ij} g_j\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\mbf{D}$ denotes matrix of material coefficients. The simplest Fourier's law uses diagonal matrix $\mbf{D}$
where conduction coefficients are located on the diagonal.
Flux of any quantity is used in conservation law which has form
\begin{equation}
{\rm div} \mbf{q} = 0\ ,\ \ \ \ \ \
\ppd{q_i}{x_i} = 0\ .
\end{equation}

Previously described strategy is valid when one medium is transported. In case of several, say $n$, transported media,
the situation is more complicated. Each of $n$ media has its own macroscopic quantity which defines state of the medium
and is denoted as $f_i$. Gradient of each quantity can be computed and is denoted as
\begin{equation}
\mbf{g}^i = {\rm grad}\ f_i\ ,\ \ \ \ \ \
g_j^i = \ppd{f_i}{x_j}\ .
\end{equation}
Superscript denotes the quantity and subscript denotes the component.
Fluxes of particular quantities are linear combinations of gradients multiplied by material coefficients.
They can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\mbf{q}^i = \sum_{j=1}^n \mbf{D}_j^i \mbf{g}^j\ ,\ \ \ \ \
q_j^i = D_{jk}^m g_k^m\ .
\end{equation}
The constitutive matrix $\mbf{D}_j^i$ defines interaction between the $i$-th flux and the $j$-th gradient.

\section{Combination of material models}

It is possible to combine relations for material models in a system of equations of transport problems.
It must fulfill following rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item{relations for material model must be derived from the same approach (theory)}
\item{relations for material model must be derived for the same unknowns}
\item{something else ...}
\end{itemize}
For example, if you compute drying of concrete specimen made from high performance concrete C60, 
you are using the theory of multi-phase porous medium (Lewis' and Schrefler's approach). 
You decided that every equations and relations will be set for C60 concrete, 
but relations for C30 concrete will be better to use for describing heat transfer.
In this case you are using following system of equations for three unknowns 
$p^c$ [Pa] capillary pressure, $p^g$ [Pa] capillary gas pressure and $T$ [K] temperature

\begin{eqnarray}
\left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
\tenss{K}_{cc}{\rm(C60)} & \tenss{K}_{cg}{\rm(C60)} & \tenss{K}_{cT}{\rm(C60)} \\
