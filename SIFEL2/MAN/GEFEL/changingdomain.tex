\chapter{Changing domains}

In some cases, a problem is defined on a domain which is developping
in time or during analysis. Casting of concrete structure can serve as
a typical example.

In order to describe domain which is developping, additional tools for
nodes and elements have to be defined. Namely, degrees of freedom
and elements have their time function which indicates whether they
are switched on or off. Usually, the time functions have two values,
where 0 means that the entity is switched off and the value 1 means
that the entity is switched on. In more complicated cases, where
several degrees of freedom are connected, the time function has to return
integer number greater than 1. All degrees of freedom with the same
integer number greater than 1 will have the same code number and they
are assumed to be switched on.

Time functions for degrees of freedom are read as constraints.
It means, that the number of constraints must be equal to the
number of all nodes and the following numbers are not stored in
array cn but in array tgf. The array cn is filled by 1 everywhere.
Time functions for elements are read after code numbers on elements
and before the number of materials. They are stored in variable tgf.
