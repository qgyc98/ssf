\begin{equation}
\mbf{K} \mbf{d} = \mbf{f}
\end{equation}

\section{Forced vibration problems}
\begin{equation}
\mbf{M}\nod{2}{\mbf{d}}{t} + \mbf{C}\od{\mbf{d}}{t} + \mbf{K}\mbf{d} = \mbf{f}

\section{Time dependent non-dynamic problems}
\begin{equation}
\mbf{K} \dot{\mbf{r}} = \dot{\mbf{f}} +
\int_{V} \mbf{B}^T \mbf{D} \dot{\mbf{\varepsilon}}_{vp}\ {\rm d}V
\end{equation}

\section{Earth pressure problems}
Special case of nonlinear static problem, which is characterized by the equation
\begin{equation}
\mbf{K}(\mbf{d}) \mbf{d} = \mbf{f}(\mbf{d})
\end{equation}
It is usefull for solution earth pressures using General Lateral Pressure Theory
